# Rust Data Structures and Algorithms

I'm diving into data structures and algorithms with Rust to practice for interviews, and improve my understanding of Rust. This repository contains Rust implementations of various data structures and algorithms, organized into two main sections:

#### Safe Rust Data Structures:

Data structures built exclusively using safe Rust.

#### Interviews Exposed:

Code and solutions from the book "Interviews Exposed", which may include unsafe code.
